;; Data definitions:

("PROBLEM A:

Design a data definition to represent a movie, including  
title, budget, and year released.

To help you to create some examples, find some interesting movie facts below: 
\"Inside Out\" - budget: 175000000 released: 2015
\"Up\" - budget: 175000000 released: 2009
\"How to Train your Dragon\" - budget: 165000000 released: 2010

However, feel free to resarch more on your own!")

;; Functions:
#;
("PROBLEM B:

You have a list of movies you want to watch, but you like to watch your 
rentals in chronological order. Design a function that consumes two movies 
and produces the title of the most recently released movie.

Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two compound data 
parameters is for the template to include all the selectors for both 
parameters.")
